Do not code marked crossings in locations where pedestrians do not have a right-of-way. Only record crossing facilities which provide some safety benefit to pedestrians such as: \n• Pedestrian-specific signalization (if adhered to) \n• Physical protection by things such as refuge islands, curb build-outs (narrowed crossing points), or \n• Traffic calming measures, such as raised crossings or shared zones (where vehicle speeds are limited to ≤10km/h).\n\nWhen is a pedestrian crossing signalised? Signalised pedestrian crossings require pedestrian-specific signals. Where a pedestrian crossing is at a signalised intersection, the pedestrian crossing is only considered signalised if: \n• Pedestrian-specific signals are present, and \n• A pedestrian signal phase provides pedestrians with effective right-of-way. \n\nWhat is a refuge island? A refuge island must be a purpose-built, safe mid-way stopping point for pedestrians. It must provide adequate space and protection from passing vehicles and be seen by drivers. Do not code poorly designed refuge islands of insufficient width or protection.\n\nPedestrian refuges on divided roads For roads with divided carriageways, do not code medians as refuge islands.
